Make sure to take the folder named "tastybites site test files" out of the zip file and into a location like documents to view the site, if you don't do this the website won't work as intended. 

If it loads without css and images after clicking on the file and opening it in chrome, just go to another webpage within the site and then using the nav bar return to the nav page, this should fix everything.
